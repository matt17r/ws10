    <p class="mt-6 max-w-2xl lg:max-w-4xl text-xl/7 text-gray-600">Here's a bunch of questions I've been asked a few times in one way or another.

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">How fast do I need to be?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">The timing will stop at 1 hour 20 minutes. If you can finish a parkrun in less than 35 minutes, without almost dying, you can probably complete a WS10 in the available time.</dd>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">What if I'm slower than that?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">If you can't finish in 1 hour 20 minutes but you're still keen to participate, let me know. I'm open to having an earlier start time for slower runners.</dd>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">How do I register?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">You only need to register on the site once, and then you can show up to any event. To register go to <%= link_to "the sign up page", sign_up_path, class: "font-medium text-[#54494B] hover:text-[#9DA39A] underline underline-offset-[3px] hover:no-underline" %> and fill in your details. Don't forget to click on the confirmation link in your email afterwards!</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">I tried to register, why didn't I get a confirmation email?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">The most likely reason is that it went to spam, check your spam for an email from <span class="font-medium">matt@ws10.run</span>. Mark it as not spam (and then try again if the confirmation link has expired). The next most likely reason is a typo in your email address (don't worry, it can happen to anyone). Register again and make sure you're typing it correctly.</dd>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">How much does it cost to participate?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">Nothing, it's completely free. I may have to start charging a small amount in future to cover costs, but for now the event is free.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">No seriously, how much does it actually cost?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">Seriously, it costs nothing! At the moment it's completely free to participate!</dd>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">How can such an awesome, well-organised event be free?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">It's so kind of you to say that! ðŸ˜œ First, this is a hobby (weird hobby, I know) so I've been able to keep the costs super low by doing most of it myself... web development, marketing, course planning, signage, results, etc. Second, I have a very understanding wife who has tolerated me spending a small amount of money on my hobby (to buy a domain name, a banner and some drinks or snacks each month).</dd>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">How can I contribute to WS10?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">There are 3 main ways you can contribute:
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
              <li>Come along and participate! Having a friendly group of people makes it worth organising.</li>
              <li>Invite others! Bring along some friendly, enthusiastic people to run with us.</li>
              <li>Volunteer occasionally! Perhaps you can do the timing one month? Or bring an esky and some water bottles? Let me know if you're keen to help and we can figure something out!</li>
            </ol>
          </dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt class="text-xl/7 font-medium text-gray-900">Can I donate some money to help cover the costs?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">I guess! I haven't built a payment or donation system (I'm trying to keep things lean) but if you really want to chip in $10, my PayID is <span class="font-medium">matt@ws10.run</span>.</dd>
