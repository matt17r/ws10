        <p class="mt-4 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">
          I've got some ideas to improve WS10 but most of them require money. Some things I'd like to improve are:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-4 text-xl/7 text-gray-600 list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
          <li>An additional banner for improved event signage - $175</li>
          <li>Cones and sign holders for improved course signage (especially at Bungrarribee) - $125</li>
          <li>Sports first aid kit in case of grazes or sprains - $90</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">
          Other one-off or regular costs I (voluntarily) incurred in 2025 include:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-4 text-xl/7 text-gray-600 list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Small WS10 banner - $162</li>
          <li>Printing, signage and consumables such as staples and cable ties - $50</li>
          <li>Domain name and site hosting - $45.20 per year</li>
          <li>Drinks (and ice) in hotter months - $15 per event</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4 text-xl/7 text-gray-600">
          I'd like to keep WS10 free but this year I'm going to make more of a push for financial support from those who regularly enjoy it. Your contribution will help improve the event experience for everyone.
